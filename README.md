DSA210-TermProject -> Chicago Crime Rate Analysis


Objective

This project aims to find out what has affected crime in Chicago in recent years and to what extent. By collecting the weather conditions, location, population of the place, type of crime (murder, theft, violence, etc.), date of the incident (time, day, month, year), etc., the crime data will be examined under what conditions the crime data increases and to what extent the crime type increases.



Motivation

Last summer, I lived in Chicago, USA for 3 months as part of the Work and Travel program. Although I liked the city very much, many people said that the crime rates were very high. Therefore, I thought that the crime rates might have been high because it was summer. Also, since there are many thoughts about the effect of hot climate on crime rates, I wanted to research this subject. I also added more criterion to my research such as location and population. I am also considering America for my master's degree in the future. I thought that Chicago's crime data would also be useful for my city preferences.
