DSA210-TermProject -> Chicago Crime Rate Analysis

Objective
The purpose of this project is to understand whether weather conditions cause a noticeable increase in crime rates. Weather data of the crimes that occurred that day will be collected and examined to investigate whether the weather conditions have an increasing, decreasing or neutral effect on the number of crimes. In addition, it will be investigated which crimes these weather conditions have a particular effect on and which types of crimes (murder, theft, harassment, etc.) are greatly affected by weather conditions. For this, crime data from the last few years in Chicago will be used.

Motivation
Last summer, I lived in Chicago, USA for 3 months as part of the Work and Travel program. Although I liked the city very much, many people said that the crime rates were very high. Therefore, I thought that the crime rates might have been high because it was summer. Also, since there are many thoughts about the effect of hot climate on crime rates, I wanted to research this subject. I am also considering America for my master's degree in the future. I thought that Chicago's crime data would also be useful for my city preferences.

Data Collection

-Where will the data come from?
  Crime statistics are shared in detail via the Chicago Data Portal (data.cityofchicago.org).
  Chicago crime data database on kaggle.

-What information will I collect?

*Case Number
*Date 
*Block
*IUCR
*Primary Type
*Description
*Location Desription
*Arrest
*Domestic

Tools & Technologies

Python for working with data
Pandas to organize and analyze the dataset
Matplotlib & Seaborn to create charts and graphs
BeautifulSoup/Selenium for web scraping

How Will I Analyze the Data?

1.Collect Data: Crime cases from sources like Kaggle, Official Source (Chicago Data Portal) etc.

2.Clean Data:  Remove missing or incorrect values and make sure the data is structured properly.

3.Explore the Data: 
-Check the impact of weather on certain types of crime (burglary, harassment, murder).
-Create graphs to visualize trends.

4.Test Hypotheses:
In which weather conditions are most crimes committed?
Which crime is most affected by weather conditions?

5.Findings & Conclusions: Summarize the key takeaways.


Possible Future Improvements
Collecting data from more websites to get better results.
Using machine learning to predict car prices based on the data
Adding extra details like gender, economic prosperity , age and education (for example women are affected by weather condition more etc.)
